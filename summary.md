# **SUMMARY OF ASSAY**
This week I use some of my time reading the paper about slim gragh.Since I am a rookie,I just read abstract,introduction and conclusion. It's conception is somewhat too new to me,but I still have a little harvest.
Slim graph,as the paper says,is a kind of programming model and framework for lossy graph compression.From my simple point of view,it is use to evaluate methods of slimming a huge gragh,and choose the best for different kinds of machine. In fact,I think it necessary to use this tool,as the graghs nowadays contains so much information and take up a lot of storage space.We daily use,however,not all of them to work,which brings waste in some way and that actually blocks the improvement of technology.
In the future,Slim Graph is predict to be used in facilitating approximate graph processing,storage,and analytics.That can be popular,since storage is always a huge problem.
